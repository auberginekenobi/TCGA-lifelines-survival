# TCGA-lifelines-survival
Survival analysis on the KIRC cohort of TCGA cancer patients. Done on the lifelines platform. Code provided as-is, no guarantees, all that stuff. I'm far too lazy to clean it up, but the notebook runs.

Data: 
Obtained from The Broad Institute's Firehose. Files used are KIRC.Merge_Clinical and KIRC.illuminahiseq_rnaseqv2-RSEM_genes_normalized.
